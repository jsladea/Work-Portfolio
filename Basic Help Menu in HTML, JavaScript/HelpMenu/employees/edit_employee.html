            <h3>Reseting an Employee's Password:</h3>
            <p>This is only necessary if an employee can not remember the answers to their security questions.
                <strong>Note:</strong> This will only reset an employee's uLearn password if they are not using windows login.
                If an employee has a windows login, then they will need to contact the IT department to reset their password.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Navigate to the Edit Employee page.

                    The employee can reset their password from the login screen of the uLearn application.

            <h3>Change an Employee's Username</h3>
            <p>
                If an employee changes their windows login username with the IT department, you will need to update it in the uLearn application as well.
                This will work for both employees using windows login and employees using the uLearn login system.
            </p>
