        <h1>Assign Training to Employees by Department</h1>

        <h3>The Assign Training page can be found under the "Add" section of the Training Menu in the Management tab.</h3>

        <p>
            Assigning trainings to employees by department does <strong>not</strong> assign trainings to a department.
            It assigns the trainings to the selected employees of the selected departments.  It is useful for assigning a training to a group of employees in a department(s)
            when the training will only need to be completed by those specific employees and not need to be assigned to new employees or employees added to that department.
