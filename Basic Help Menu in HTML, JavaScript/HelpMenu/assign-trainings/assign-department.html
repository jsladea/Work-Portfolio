        <h1>Assign Training to Department</h1>

        <h3>The Assign Training page can be found under the "Add" section of the Training Menu in the Management tab.</h3>

        <p>
            Assigning trainings to a department assigns trainings to all employees currently in that department and automatically assigns the trainings to all future employees added to the department.
            It is useful when a training is required for all current and future employees in a department.
            <strong>NOTE!:</strong> Assigning a training to a department will assign it to child departments of that department
            (Example: assigning a training to the quality department will assign the training to the Lab department as well).
