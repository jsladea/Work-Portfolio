                The dashboard has a table titled "Pending Tasks".  In this table are listed the trainings completed by employees that are waiting for 
                    management approval. Approval tasks show up in this table when employees did not meet the minimum requirements for automatic approval 
                    of their trainings.  If the employee took more than the allowed attempts to satisfactorily complete a training quiz, management approval 
                    will be required to complete the training process.
