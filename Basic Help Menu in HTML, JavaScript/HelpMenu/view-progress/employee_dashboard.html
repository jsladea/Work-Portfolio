            <h3>Using the Dashboard:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The dashboard has two tables. The "Past Due Trainings" table shows trainings assigned to you that have not been completed and are 
                    past their due dates.
                    <br>
                    The "Upcoming Trainings" table shows the trainings assigned to you that must be completed in the near future.
                    <br>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    In each table you can see information about the trainings: whether they are required, their due date, name, description, and type.
                    You can order the trainings in each table by any of these categories by clicking the category header in the first row of the table.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can view the training documents/videos by double clicking on the row of the table for the training that you wish to view.
                    Then press the "View Training" button.
                    <br>
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Once a row is double clicked a popup will appear.  
                    Sometimes this popup will appear on a different monitor if you are using multiple monitors.
                </li>
