        <h3>The "Unassign Training" button can be found in the "Training Menu" section of the "Management Tools" toolbar in the management tab.</h3>

        <p>
            Unassigning training from an employee removes the training from that employee.
            You may choose to unassign a training from a department for future department employees. You may also unassign a training for current and future department employees.
